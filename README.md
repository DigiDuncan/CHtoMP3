***I am not associated with Clone Hero, or the artists used for custom song charts, in any way. This program, and custom song charts in general, are of dubious legality, but let's be real, the FBI has bigger fish to fry.***


***Please, only use CHtoMP3 on songs and charts you have the legal and moral right to convert.***
